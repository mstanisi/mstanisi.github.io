              Working with the NSF-funded project <em>Aquasteady</em>, I built models with USDA data to predict trends in irrigation and sustainability.
            </summary>
            <br>
            Aquasteady is an NSF-funded project developing a seaweed-based hydrogel that helps farms maintain soil moisture and withstand irregular weather patterns caused by climate change. 
            As part of my assistantship with them I analyzed 20 years of federal census polling American farmers on how they may be struggling to meet their sustainability goals. 
            <br><br>
            I found that the data was multi-correlated, meaning that farms nation-wide were failing to meet irrigation standards on all fronts. 
            While this was enough to confirm a need for the solution Aquasteady was providing, I wanted to delve into what was driving this overall trend as well as what watersheds were struggling the most. 
            <br><br>
            While cleaning the data I found that filtering by the amount of acres irrigated as the metric provided the least noisy <em>correlation matrix</em>. 
            Regardless, implementing machine learning methods for feature selection would be essential. 
            <br><br>
            First I implemented a <em>Random Forest Classifier</em> to rank the significance of each region and prune the ones with abnormally low scores. 
            After this, I implemented a <em>Ridge Regression</em> in order to pare my data down to the most significant features. 
            <br><br>
            After pruning the features of all low-ranking score, I interpolated the data to do a <em>k-means cluster analysis</em> on the geographic regions. 
            States and their respective watersheds correlated together and revealed outlier regions, such as California and the Texas Gulf. I took note of these for future spatial analysis. 
            <br><br>
            A final <em>linear regression</em> revealed that the risk of reduced crop yield and a lack of finances were the fastest growing barriers to sustainability for US farms.

              While working at the <em>Pratt School of Architecture</em>, I helped catalog a collection of over 2000 books and ephemera for the newly opened Reading Room. 
              I then designed a <em>relational database</em> to allow students to browse titles and loan them out. 
              With <em>PostgreSQL</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> I coded an interface for an operational library management system. 
              </summary>
              <br>
              The Pratt School of Architecture houses the book collection of the late professor William "Bill" Menking. 
              Along with countless titles related to design and critical theory, included in the collection are a host of magazines, blueprints and exhibition catalogs. 
              <br><br>
              During the summer, I had the job of writing <em>metadata</em> for every title and then organizing them in the stacks by Dewey Decimal. 
              During the school year, I designed an <em>ERD</em> to store the data and facilitate a library system where members of the Pratt community could browse the collection online and loan titles out. 
              <br><br>
              The <em>SQL</em> architecture I wrote allows administrators to register members with valid Pratt IDs, manage fees, and update the catalog at will. 
              On the user-end, members can browse by subject tags and place holds on titles that catch their eye. 
              <br><br>
              For the interface, I used a <em>Postgres</em> relational database to ensure scalability when incorporated into <em>JavaScript</em>. 
              The end-product focuses on data integrity, easy querying and seamless transactions. I kept the design rudimentary.

              <em>Novabot</em> is a fine-tuned LLM model that emulates the "cut-up" technique pioneered by writer William S. Burroughs, wherein a list of words and phrases are clipped and rearranged into new, original passages. 
              </summary>
              <br>
               This project is premised on a lost manuscript known as the "Word Hoard" by experimental writer William S. Burroughs. 
               The manuscript consisted of around 1000 typewriter pages written between 1954 and 1958. 
               Burroughs physically cut up the manuscript and rearranged the words and phrases to develop a series of five novels, beginning with Naked Lunch and ending with Nova Express. 
               <br><br>
               Using <em>NumPy</em> I ingested each novel as a text file and extracted the intersection between them all as set objects, creating a massive list of words that would serve as my word hoard. 
               After cleaning the list of characters and digits, I imported the <em>GPT2</em> transformer and tokenizer from <em>HuggingFace</em>. 
               <br><br>
               Using <em>PyTorch</em> I then fine-tuned the model on Naked Lunch so that the output would resemble the style of Burroughs while forcing the vocabulary of the word hoard with <em>prompt engineering</em>. 
               Once prompted, the model outputs passages using the same algorithmic process that inspired Burroughs' original writings. 
               <br><br>
               Due to the lack of GPU power, I wasn't able to test out more powerful or versatile models like GPT-4 or Llama 3. 
               Further prompt engineering and constrained decoding will also be necessary before a web app can be developed. 
               <br><br>
               This project remains public on <em>GitHub</em> for others to pull and test out to their liking.

              <em>Trust, Apprehension and Chatbots</em> is a research paper that looks at various use-cases of AI tools in educational and vocational settings, exploring the notion of trust in human-computer interaction and the lack thereof. 
              The efficacy of chatbots for university students in particular is analyzed with <em>R</em> and visualized in <em>Tableau</em>.
            </summary>
                <br>
                During my first semester at Pratt Institute, the use of LLM-powered chatbots by students was becoming rampant across the globe. 
                When it came time to write my final paper, I wanted to explore not only how this trend was affecting student cognition but also how our relationship to AI could be different. 
                <br><br>
                Inspired by the cyberneticist philosophies of the mid-century, I guided my <em>bibliographic research</em> towards studies that emphasized a high level of inquiry and user-engagement. 
                I supported my outlook on the conceptual premises of <em>machine learning</em>, which stresses a transparent use of data distinct from the complex ambiguity of modern AI systems. 
                <br><br>
                Because the main feature of machine learning is its capacity to learn, I drew from educational settings first before delving into the vocational. 
                I found that elementary school students experienced the most freedom and growth using AI tools because they were fostered within a "community of inquiry," as one study described. 
                University students, on the other hand, lacked this freedom and only used AI as a means to save time on homework. 
                <br><br>
                Plotting survey data in a <em>linear regression</em> revealed that low GPAs correlated positively with a high dependency on AI. 
                The relationship was opposite for elementary school students, as those that excelled tended to find the most satisfaction with the new technologies. 
                <br><br>
                This dichotomy of trust and apprehension translated neatly into studies of vocational contexts. 
                Workers only appreciated the use of AI when they were able to modulate between automatic and manual use of the system at hand. 
                This fostered a sense of learning along with the technology that improved efficiency on all fronts. 
                Studies where this trust did not manifest saw the worker in scenarios of high-stress, where the use of AI was implemented in order to replace them in their role. 
                <br><br>
                As AI continues to revolutionize the tech industry, this project still advises my perspective on the state of things and motivates me to build my own community of inquiry.
